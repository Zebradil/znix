# `nix run .#cache-push` app and the CI push-nix-cache action.
#
# Configuration is read from the environment (each step is skipped when its
# inputs are empty, so a key-less or credential-less run is a no-op for that
# step):
#   CACHE_S3_URL              s3:// URL for `nix copy --to`     (skip push when empty)
#   CACHE_SIGNING_KEY_FILE    key file for `nix store sign`     (skip signing when empty)
#   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
#   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY     S3 credentials                    (skip push when empty)
#
# kasha generation-manifest emission runs after a successful push, and only
# when both of the first two are set:
#   KASHA_FLAKE               flake id the manifest is filed under (roots/<flake>/)
#   KASHA_BIN                 path to the `kasha` binary that emits the manifest
#   KASHA_GEN                 generation id  ┐
#   KASHA_BRANCH              retention tier ├ --paths-file mode only; derived
#   KASHA_ATTR                retention group┘ from git + the attr otherwise
#
# Store paths come from exactly one source:
#   --paths-file FILE   newline-separated, pre-resolved store paths (the CI path)
#   ATTR...             flake attrs to resolve, e.g. checks.aarch64-darwin.foo-build
